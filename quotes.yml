    quotes:
      - "The two-minute rule is magic."
      - "My best trick is costume - the clothing I put on or take off. If I put on exercise gear, I’ll start to feel like exercising; if I don’t, I’m very likely to feel like doing something else."
      - "Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax."
      - "Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does."
      - "First of all, if it's on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind, or what I call a collection bucket, that you know you’ll come back to regularly and sort through."
      - "Most often, the reason something is 'on your mind' is that you want it to be different than it currently is, and yet you haven’t clarified exactly what the intended outcome is; you haven’t decided what the very next physical action step is; and/or you haven’t put reminders of the outcome and the action required in a system you trust."
      - "There is no reason ever to have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought."
      - "We (1) collect things that command our attention; (2) process what they mean and what to do about them; and (3) organize the results, which we (4) review as options for what we choose to (5) do."
      - "Most people feel best about their work the week before their vacation, but it’s not because of the vacation itself. What do you do the last week before you leave on a big trip? You clean up, close up, clarify, and renegotiate all your agreements with yourself and others. I just suggest that you do this weekly instead of yearly."

    author: "David Heinemeier Hansson, Jason Fried"
    quotes:
      - "The office during the day has become the last place people want to be when they really want to get work done. That’s because offices have become interruption factories."
      - "Stop commuting your life away."
      - "The new luxury is the luxury of freedom and time. Once you’ve had a taste of that life, no corner office or fancy chef will be able to drag you back."
      - "Worth counting too is the number of days you spend at the office emailing someone who sits only three desks away."
      - "Most work is not coming up with The Next Big Thing. Rather, it’s making better the thing you already thought of six months—or six years—ago."
      - "Our attitude is, we need a clean plate before going up for seconds."
      - "InterGuard alone claims ten thousand clients, and research group Gartner estimates that 60 percent of employees will suffer from some sort of Big Brother invasion by 2015."
      - "As Sir Richard Branson commented in his ode to working remotely, 'To successfully work with other people, you have to trust each other. A big part of this is trusting people to get their work done wherever they are, without supervision.'"
      - "If you’re working on the couch in front of the TV, well, it’s tempting to reach for the remote. If you’re sitting in the kitchen, you may find yourself thinking of emptying the dishwasher. But if you’re sitting in a dedicated room intended for work with the door closed, you stand a far better chance of staying on task."
      - "The best cultures derive from actions people actually take, not the ones they write about in a mission statement."
      - "It’s almost zen-like to let go of the frenzy, to let answers flow back to you when the other party is ready to assist. Use that calm to be even more productive."
      - "It’s rarely spelled out directly, but a lot of the arguments against working remotely are based on the fear of losing control."
      - "Because reptilian resistance is not rational but deeply emotional—even instinctual—the excuse 'but I’ll lose control' is the toughest to overcome."
      - "When you and your coworkers are sitting in the same place, it’s easy to feel that you’re up to speed on what’s going on in the company. […] Working remotely doesn’t automatically create that flow."
      - "We believe that these staples of work life—meetings and managers—are actually the greatest causes of work not getting done at the office."
      - "Constantly asking people what they’re working on prevents them from actually doing the work they’re describing."
      - "All those dreaded status meetings, interruptions for estimates, and planning sessions have a curious way of adding up exactly to a manager’s workweek."
      - "A manager’s natural instinct is to worry about his workers not getting enough work done, but the real threat is that too much will likely get done. And because the manager isn’t sitting across from his worker anymore, he can’t look in the person’s eyes and see burnout."
      - "If anything, the human connection is even more important when hiring remote workers because it has to be stronger to survive the distance."
      - "That’s one of the key challenges of remote work. Keeping everyone’s outlook healthy and happy. That task is insurmountable if you’ve stacked your team with personalities who tend to let their inner asshole loose every now and again."
      - "The old adage still applies. No assholes allowed. But for remote work, you need to extend it to no asshole-y behavior allowed, no drama allowed, no bad vibes allowed."
      - "When you’re seeking remote workers, you have to do even more to encourage and nurture diversity and personal development."

    quotes:
      - "I turned in a lab report written from the rat's point of view. The report described how, merely by pressing a bar, it had trained a college student to engage in breakfast-feeding behavior."
      - "It is an integral part of the American myth that anyone who sets his mind to it can succeed, that diligence eventually pays off."
      - "Likewise, when we call out a hearty 'Good girl!' in response to a child's performance, the most appropriate reply would seem to be 'Woof!'"

    quotes:
      - "Waste not want not. I am not being wasted. Why do I want?"
      - "Like other things now, thought must be rationed. There’s a lot that doesn’t bear thinking about. Thinking can hurt your chances, and I intend to last."
      - "There is more than one kind of freedom, said Aunt Lydia. Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Don’t underrate it."
      - "We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice."
      - "When we think of the past it’s the beautiful things we pick out. We want to believe it was all like that."
