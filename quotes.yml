    quotes:
      - "The two-minute rule is magic."
      - "My best trick is costume - the clothing I put on or take off. If I put on exercise gear, I’ll start to feel like exercising; if I don’t, I’m very likely to feel like doing something else."
      - "Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax."
      - "Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does."
      - "First of all, if it's on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind, or what I call a collection bucket, that you know you’ll come back to regularly and sort through."
      - "Most often, the reason something is 'on your mind' is that you want it to be different than it currently is, and yet you haven’t clarified exactly what the intended outcome is; you haven’t decided what the very next physical action step is; and/or you haven’t put reminders of the outcome and the action required in a system you trust."
      - "There is no reason ever to have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought."
      - "We (1) collect things that command our attention; (2) process what they mean and what to do about them; and (3) organize the results, which we (4) review as options for what we choose to (5) do."
      - "Most people feel best about their work the week before their vacation, but it’s not because of the vacation itself. What do you do the last week before you leave on a big trip? You clean up, close up, clarify, and renegotiate all your agreements with yourself and others. I just suggest that you do this weekly instead of yearly."
